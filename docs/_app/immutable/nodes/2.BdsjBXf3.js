Launched as a simple yet powerful tool, it addresses a key gap in traditional mining calculators: the compounding impact of network difficulty growth over extended periods. As of December 27, 2025, with Bitcoin's network difficulty at approximately 148.26 trillion, block reward at 3.125 BTC post-2024 halving, and price hovering around $88,000, accurate long-term modeling has become essential for miners facing intense competition and rising operational challenges.</p> <p>Unlike basic daily or weekly profit estimators, this simulator runs projections over 24 or 36 months, applying a user-defined monthly difficulty increase percentage. This reflects real-world dynamics where even modest growth rates—typically 2-5% monthly in competitive phases—can erode rewards significantly. The tool calculates monthly revenue based on the rig's hash rate share of total network rewards, subtracts fixed electricity costs, and accumulates net profits to derive a final ROI percentage. Results include a detailed table with exponential difficulty notation and a line chart visualizing cumulative profit trends.</p> <p>Built as a stateless static site, all computations occur in your browser using pure JavaScript—no data is collected, stored, or transmitted. This ensures complete privacy while delivering fast, reliable simulations. The model assumes constant coin price and electricity rates, focusing on difficulty as the primary variable factor, though users can adjust block rewards and other parameters for custom scenarios, such as other proof-of-work chains or future halvings.</p> <p>Efficient rigs like those delivering 200 TH/s can show extraordinary profitability in current conditions, often generating millions in monthly revenue initially. However, higher difficulty growth rates quickly highlight breakeven points or potential losses, empowering users to make informed decisions about hardware purchases, upgrades, or operational timelines. The simulator aligns with the original Software Requirements Specification (SRS), emphasizing three core functional requirements: intuitive input collection, accurate client-side ROI simulation, and clear results display with table and chart visualizations.</p> <p>Whether you're a hobbyist evaluating a single rig or a small-scale operator planning fleet expansions, this tool provides educational insights into mining economics without external dependencies. Projections are estimates only—not financial advice—and serve to illustrate trends under defined assumptions. By incorporating real-time data like today's Bitcoin metrics, users gain a practical view of how network expansion influences sustainability in a post-halving era.</p> <p>Ultimately, the Rig Lifecycle Simulator promotes transparency in an often opaque industry, helping users anticipate when hardware might transition from profitable to marginal. Explore the linked blog for in-depth articles on calculation models, parameter explanations, and limitations.</p></section> <section id="how-to" class="glass-card p-5 mb-5 mx-2 svelte-1uha8ag"><h2 class="fw-bold" style="color: var(--primary-lilac);">How to Use the Rig Lifecycle Simulator</h2> <p class="text-muted">Getting started with the Rig Lifecycle Simulator is straightforward. This guide walks you through entering parameters, running simulations, and interpreting outputs for meaningful profitability projections. All processing happens locally in your browser, ensuring speed and privacy.</p> <p>First, gather realistic data for accuracy. As of December 27, 2025, Bitcoin's difficulty is around 148.26 trillion—check sources like Blockchain.com or CoinWarz for the latest. Coin price is approximately $88,000, with the post-2024 halving block reward at 3.125 BTC and about 144 blocks per day. For your rig, note the purchase cost, hash rate in TH/s (e.g., 200 for modern ASICs), power consumption in watts (often 3000–4000), and local electricity rate (e.g., $0.12/kWh).</p> <p>Begin on the main form. In the left column, input hardware details: rig cost (total upfront investment), hash rate, power consumption, electricity cost, and coin price. These drive revenue and expense calculations. On the right, set network parameters: initial difficulty (current value), monthly difficulty increase percentage (2-5% is realistic based on recent trends), simulation period (24 or 36 months), block reward, and blocks per day.</p> <p>Defaults provide a starting point, but customize for your scenario. For conservative estimates, use higher difficulty growth; for optimistic, lower rates. Click "Run Lifecycle Simulation" to generate results via URL query parameters—bookmarkable for later reference.</p> <p>On the results page, review the monthly table first. It shows evolving difficulty (in exponential notation for large numbers), revenue (declining as your network share shrinks), constant costs, net profit (positive or negative), and cumulative profit. Positive net months add to totals; negatives indicate losses eating into prior gains.</p> <p>Next, examine the line chart for cumulative profit over time. Upward trends signal sustained profitability; flattening or declines highlight diminishing returns. The final ROI summary expresses total outcome as a percentage—massive positives are possible in high-price environments, while negatives warn of potential unprofitability.</p> <p>Refine by running multiple simulations: vary difficulty growth to test sensitivity, adjust price for bear/bull cases, or modify rewards for halvings. Share URLs to compare scenarios. Remember assumptions like fixed price and no hardware degradation—combine with external factors for holistic planning.</p> <p>This step-by-step process aligns with the tool's functional requirements: easy input collection, precise simulation, and readable displays. Use it to evaluate new rigs against current metrics or forecast existing ones through 2027–2028.</p></section> <section id="faq" class="glass-card p-5 mb-5 mx-2 svelte-1uha8ag"><h2 class="fw-bold" style="color: var(--primary-lilac);">Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <div class="mt-4"><h6>What data sources should I use for inputs?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">For Bitcoin as of December 27, 2025: difficulty ~148.26 trillion (from Blockchain.com or CoinWarz), price ~$88,000 (major exchanges), block reward 3.125 BTC, blocks per day ~144. Update regularly for accuracy.</p> <h6>Does the simulator account for halvings?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">Manually adjust the block reward to model halvings. For example, average rewards if a halving falls mid-period, or run separate simulations before/after the event (next expected ~2028).</p> <h6>Why is revenue sometimes extremely high?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">At current high Bitcoin prices and efficient rigs (e.g., 200 TH/s), initial monthly revenue can reach millions. This reflects real 2025 profitability before difficulty erodes shares.</p> <h6>Can difficulty decrease in projections?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">Use negative monthly increase percentages to model miner capitulation scenarios, though long-term trends are upward.</p> <h6>Is transaction fee revenue included?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">No—the model focuses on block subsidies for consistency. Fees vary and are often minor compared to the 3.125 BTC reward.</p> <h6>How accurate are the projections?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">Estimates under user assumptions (constant price/costs). Real outcomes depend on volatility, fees, and unforeseen events. Not financial advice.</p> <h6>Why no hardware degradation modeling?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">Keeps the tool simple and fast. Assume constant performance; factor efficiency drops manually via adjusted power/hash rate over time.</p> <h6>Can I use this for other cryptocurrencies?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">Yes—for similar proof-of-work chains. Adjust block reward, blocks per day, and difficulty to match the target network.</p> <h6>Is my data private?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">Completely—stateless client-side tool. Inputs process in-browser only; no collection or transmission.</p> <h6>Why focus on 24-36 months?</h6> <p class="text-muted small">Aligns with typical ASIC lifecycles, capturing difficulty compounding and potential halvings while remaining practical.</p></div></section></div>`);function Ee(e,t){me(t,!1);let c=d(1e3),o=d(100),s=d(3e3),a=d(.1),u=d(6e4),n=d(1e12),f=d(5),p=d(24),_=d(6.25),x=d(144);function ie(){const i=new URLSearchParams({rigCost:r(c).toString(),hashRate:r(o).toString(),powerConsumption:r(s).toString(),electricityCost:r(a).toString(),coinPrice:r(u).toString(),initialDifficulty:r(n).toString(),difficultyIncreasePct:r(f).toString(),periodMonths:r(p).toString(),blockReward:r(_).toString(),blocksPerDay:r(x).toString()});xe(`${G}/results?${i.toString()}`)}_e();var S=Ie();we("1uha8ag",i=>{var J=Te(),ae=l(pe(J),6);O(6),V(()=>ke(ae,"content",`${G??""}/`)),Z(()=>{he.title="Rig Lifecycle Simulator - Project Mining Rig ROI Over 2-3 Years"}),K(i,J)});var R=h(S),U=h(R),C=l(h(U),2),q=h(C),E=h(q),T=h(E),I=l(h(T),2);y(I);var B=l(I,4);y(B);var P=l(B,4);y(P);var j=l(P,4);y(j);var F=l(j,4);y(F),v(T);var H=l(T,2),L=l(h(H),2);y(L);var A=l(L,4);y(A);var k=l(A,4);V(()=>{r(p),ve(()=>{})});var M=h(k);M.value=M.__value="24";var z=l(M);z.value=z.__value="36",v(k);var D=l(k,4);y(D);var N=l(D,4);y(N),v(H),v(E),O(2),v(q),v(C),v(U),v(R),O(6),v(S),g(I,()=>r(c),i=>m(c,i)),g(B,()=>r(o),i=>m(o,i)),g(P,()=>r(s),i=>m(s,i)),g(j,()=>r(a),i=>m(a,i)),g(F,()=>r(u),i=>m(u,i)),g(L,()=>r(n),i=>m(n,i)),g(A,()=>r(f),i=>m(f,i)),Re(k,()=>r(p),i=>m(p,i)),g(D,()=>r(_),i=>m(_,i)),g(N,()=>r(x),i=>m(x,i)),ye("submit",q,Ce(ie)),Y(1,C,()=>ge,()=>({y:30,duration:800,delay:200})),Y(1,R,()=>be,()=>({duration:1e3})),K(e,S),fe()}export{Ee as component,Ue as universal};
