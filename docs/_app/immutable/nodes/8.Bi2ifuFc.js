Upon running a simulation, users receive a detailed monthly breakdown, a visual profit trend chart, and a summary ROI figure. Understanding each component helps miners draw actionable insights about long-term viability.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">The table lists every month of the projection period, showing key metrics: current difficulty in exponential notation, monthly revenue in dollars, fixed electricity costs, net profit, and cumulative profit. Difficulty grows according to the user-defined rate, while revenue declines proportionally as the rig's network share shrinks.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Reading the Monthly Table</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Revenue starts high in favorable conditions—often millions for efficient rigs at current Bitcoin prices—and decreases steadily. Costs remain constant, making net profit the difference. Positive net profit adds to cumulative totals; negative values indicate operational losses that accumulate over time.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">The Cumulative Profit Chart</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">A line chart visualizes cumulative profit over time. An upward trend signals sustained profitability, while flattening or downward slopes highlight diminishing returns or loss periods. The chart's trajectory reveals breakeven points and overall performance at a glance.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Understanding ROI</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">The final ROI percentage expresses total profit or loss relative to initial rig cost. Values above zero indicate profit multiples; for example, 100 percent means the rig doubled its cost. Extremely high positive ROI, common in late 2025 with Bitcoin near $88,000, reflects strong market conditions. Negative ROI shows the percentage loss if sold at the end of the period.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Practical Applications</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Compare scenarios by adjusting difficulty growth or price assumptions. A steeply declining chart may suggest selling the rig early, while sustained positive cumulative profit supports long-term holding. These visualizations empower data-driven decisions in an unpredictable mining landscape.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">What does exponential difficulty notation mean?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Large numbers like 1.48e+14 represent 148 trillion, standard for Bitcoin's scale.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Why might revenue vary slightly month-to-month?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">30-day month approximations and compounding difficulty create small variations.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">How should I use negative ROI results?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">They signal potential future losses under those assumptions, prompting cost reductions or timing adjustments.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">Run multiple simulations to compare outcomes and refine your mining strategy.</p></article></div>`);function j(m){var e=_();b("1li990r",u=>{var s=w(),h=v(g(s),6);t(4),r(()=>o(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),f(()=>{y.title="Interpreting Simulation Results | Rig Lifecycle Simulator Blog"}),a(u,s)});var i=l(e),d=l(i);t(4),n(i),t(2),n(e),r(()=>o(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),a(m,e)}export{j as component,L as universal};
