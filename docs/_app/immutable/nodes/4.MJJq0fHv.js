Running entirely on the client side, it provides projections over a 24- or 36-month period, factoring in one of the most critical variables in mining economics: the steady increase in network difficulty.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">As of late 2025, Bitcoin's network difficulty stands at approximately 148 trillion, with the current block reward at 3.125 BTC following the 2024 halving. Mining profitability depends heavily on how a rig's hash rate performs against this growing difficulty, alongside fixed factors like electricity costs and coin price. This simulator addresses that need by allowing users to input real-world parameters and see realistic outcomes without any data leaving their device.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why Simulate Rig Lifecycles?</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Mining is not a static activity. While short-term calculators can show daily or weekly earnings, they often overlook the compounding effect of difficulty adjustments. Over two to three years, even modest monthly increases can dramatically reduce rewards, turning an initially profitable rig into a loss-making one. The simulator highlights these shifts, helping users decide if purchasing or operating a rig makes financial sense in the current market environment.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Core Features</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Users enter details such as rig cost, hash rate in terahashes per second, power consumption in watts, electricity price per kilowatt-hour, current coin price, initial network difficulty, and a monthly difficulty growth percentage. The tool then computes monthly revenue based on the proportion of network rewards captured, subtracts operational costs, and tracks cumulative profit.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Results appear in an easy-to-read table with exponential notation for large difficulty values and a line chart showing cumulative profit trends. A final ROI percentage summarizes the overall performance, whether deeply positive in favorable conditions or negative under high difficulty growth.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">How It Helps Miners</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">By using current data—like Bitcoin's price around $88,000 and difficulty near 148 trillion—this tool reveals scenarios where efficient rigs remain highly profitable despite rising competition. It empowers informed decisions, especially for those considering new hardware in a post-halving era where rewards are halved but network security continues to strengthen.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">What units does the simulator use for hash rate?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Hash rate is entered in terahashes per second (TH/s), common for modern ASIC miners, and automatically converted internally for accurate reward calculations.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Can it model other cryptocurrencies?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">It is optimized for Bitcoin-like proof-of-work chains with similar difficulty adjustment and block times, using 144 blocks per day as default.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why focus on 2-3 year projections?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">This timeframe aligns with typical rig lifecycles, accounting for hardware wear, efficiency losses, and major network changes like halvings.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Explore the simulator today to model your own rig scenarios with real-time parameters.</p></article></div>`);function W(h){var e=k();w("1tq17n3",d=>{var a=q(),u=f(g(a),6);t(4),r(()=>l(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),y(()=>{v.title="What is the Rig Lifecycle Simulator? | Rig Lifecycle Simulator Blog"}),s(d,a)});var i=n(e),m=n(i);t(4),o(i),t(2),o(e),r(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),s(h,e)}export{W as component,T as universal};
